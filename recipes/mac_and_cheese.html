    <ul>
        <li>2 cups elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon paprika (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Cook the macaroni
            <ul>
                <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the macaroni and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Make the cheese sauce
            <ul>
                <li>In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Add the flour and whisk continuously for about 1-2 minutes until it forms a smooth paste (roux).</li>
                <li>Gradually add the milk, whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Continue to cook and whisk until the mixture thickens and starts to bubble.</li>
                <li>Reduce the heat to low and add the shredded cheddar cheese, salt, pepper, and paprika (if using). Stir until the cheese is completely melted and the sauce is smooth.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Combine
            <ul>
                <li>Add the cooked macaroni to the cheese sauce and stir until the pasta is well coated.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Serve
            <ul>
                <li>Serve immediately, or transfer to a baking dish, sprinkle with extra cheese, and bake at 350°F (175°C) for about 15-20 minutes until the top is golden and bubbly.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
